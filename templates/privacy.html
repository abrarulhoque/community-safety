            <h4>1. Information We Collect</h4>
            <p>
              We collect information you provide directly to us, such as your
              name, email address, phone number, and address when you register
              for an account, report an incident, or register a camera.
            </p>

            <h4>2. How We Use Your Information</h4>
            <p>
              We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and
              improve our services, to process incident reports, to communicate
              with you, and to help verify camera registrations.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Information Sharing</h4>
            <p>
              We share your information only with verified community safety
              leaders and law enforcement officials as necessary to fulfill the
              purpose of our services. We do not sell your personal information
              to third parties.
            </p>

            <h4>4. Camera Registry Information</h4>
            <p>
              When you register a camera, your camera's location and coverage
              area may be displayed on community maps, but your identity will
              not be visible to other community members.
            </p>

            <h4>5. Incident Reports</h4>
            <p>
              Information from incident reports may be aggregated and displayed
              on community maps and dashboards, but your identity will be
              protected unless you explicitly choose to make it public.
            </p>

            <h4>6. Data Security</h4>
            <p>
              We implement appropriate security measures to protect your
              personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, or
              disclosure.
            </p>
